HOW IT WORKS
90% of patients with diabetic neuropathy
suffer from symmetric distal
polyneuropathy/ chronic sensorimotor
neuropathy/ diabetic sensorimotor
polyneuropathy

Stocking-and-glove distribution
Nerves with the longest axons usually are
affected first, resulting in loss of vibratory
sensation initially
Followed by temperature, light touch or
pinprick testing
